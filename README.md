# reveal.js

## Installation

The **basic setup** is for authoring presentations only. The **full setup** gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source.

### Basic setup

The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser.

1. Download the latest version of reveal.js from <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases>
2. Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own
3. Open index.html in a browser to view it

### Full setup

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (4.0.0 or later)

1. Clone the reveal.js repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the reveal.js folder
   ```sh
   $ cd reveal.js
   ```

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```

1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `npm start -- --port=8001`.

### Folder Structure

- **css/** Core styles without which the project does not function
- **js/** Like above but for JavaScript
- **plugin/** Components that have been developed as extensions to reveal.js
- **lib/** All other third party assets (JavaScript, CSS, fonts)

### Fullscreen mode

Just press »F« on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the »ESC« key to exit fullscreen mode.


## MathJax

If you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, [find our more about dependencies here](#dependencies).

The plugin defaults to using [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) but that can be adjusted through the `math` configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the `mathjax` configuration value.

Below is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the `math` config object at all.

```js
Reveal.initialize({
	// other options ...

	math: {
		mathjax: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js',
		config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full'  // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html
		// pass other options into `MathJax.Hub.Config()`
		TeX: { Macros: macros }
	},

	dependencies: [
		{ src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }
	]
});
```

Read MathJax's documentation if you need [HTTPS delivery](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html#secure-access-to-the-cdn) or serving of [specific versions](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#loading-mathjax-from-the-cdn) for stability.

#### MathJax in Markdown
If you want to include math inside of a presentation written in Markdown you need to wrap the formula in backticks. This prevents syntax conflicts between LaTeX and Markdown. For example:

```
`$$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0} $$`
```
